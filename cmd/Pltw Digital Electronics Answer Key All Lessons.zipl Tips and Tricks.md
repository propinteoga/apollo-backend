If you are looking for the answer key for all the lessons in this course, you may have a hard time finding it online. This is because the answer key is not publicly available and is only accessible to teachers who have registered with Project Lead The Way (PLTW), the nonprofit organization that provides the curriculum.
 
However, there are some ways that you can try to get the answer key or at least some hints and solutions for the activities and exercises in the course. Here are some possible options:
 
- Ask your teacher for help. Your teacher may be willing to share the answer key with you or give you some guidance on how to solve the problems. This is the best and most ethical way to learn from the course and improve your skills.
- Use online resources. There are some websites that offer free or paid tutorials, videos, quizzes, and worksheets on digital electronics topics. Some examples are [Electronics Tutorials](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/), [All About Circuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/), and [Electronics Hub](https://www.electronicshub.org/). You can use these resources to supplement your learning and check your answers.
- Search for similar files. The file name "Pltw Digital Electronics Answer Key All Lessons.zipl" suggests that it is a compressed file that contains multiple PDF files for each lesson. You can try to search for similar files online using keywords such as "pltw digital electronics pdf", "pltw digital electronics answers", or "pltw digital electronics solutions". You may find some files that have similar content or format as the answer key.

However, be careful when downloading files from unknown sources, as they may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer. Also, be aware that using these files may violate the academic integrity policy of your school or PLTW, and may result in serious consequences.
 
The best way to learn from Pltw Digital Electronics is to do the activities and exercises yourself and use the answer key only as a reference or a last resort. By doing so, you will develop a deeper understanding of the concepts and skills involved in digital electronics and prepare yourself for future challenges in this field.
