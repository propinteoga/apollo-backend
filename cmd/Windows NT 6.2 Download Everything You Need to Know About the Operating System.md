If you want to download Windows NT 6.2 for free, you have a few options. One option is to download the .NET Framework 4.6.2 offline installer package from Microsoft[^2^]. This package contains the .NET Framework 4.6.2, which is a highly compatible in-place update to the .NET Framework 4, 4.5, 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.6.1 that runs on Windows NT 6.2 and other versions of Windows[^2^]. The offline installer package can be used in situations where the web installer cannot be used because of lack of Internet connectivity[^2^]. However, this option does not include the full Windows NT 6.2 operating system, only the .NET Framework that runs on it.
 
Another option is to download the .NET (Linux, macOS, and Windows) package from Microsoft[^1^]. This package contains the .NET SDK x64 Version 7.0.5, which is a cross-platform development platform that supports Windows NT 6.2 and other operating systems[^1^]. The .NET SDK x64 Version 7.0.5 includes many improvements and features, such as overall performance enhancements, new tools for cross-platform development with .NET MAUI, updates for ASP.NET Core and cloud-native development, ARM64 support, and more[^1^]. However, this option also does not include the full Windows NT 6.2 operating system, only the .NET SDK that runs on it.
 
A third option is to download Windows Server 2012 from Microsoft[^3^]. Windows Server 2012 is a server edition of Windows NT 6.2 that offers many features and services for enterprise and cloud computing[^3^]. Windows Server 2012 has several editions, such as Foundations, Essentials, and Standard[^3^]. However, this option is not free; you need to purchase a license or a subscription to use Windows Server 2012 legally[^3^]. Moreover, this option may not be suitable for personal or desktop use, as Windows Server 2012 is designed for server environments.

## Key Features of Windows NT 6.2
 
Windows NT 6.2 is the sixth major release of the Windows NT family of operating systems. It was released on October 26, 2012, along with Windows 8 for desktop and tablet devices, and Windows Server 2012 for server computers. Windows NT 6.2 introduced many new features and enhancements, some of which are:
 
- A new user interface called Metro, which is designed for touch-based devices and optimized for simplicity and speed. Metro features live tiles that display dynamic information and notifications, and a full-screen Start screen that replaces the traditional Start menu. Users can also switch to the classic desktop mode if they prefer.
- A new file system called ReFS (Resilient File System), which is based on NTFS but offers improved reliability, scalability, and performance. ReFS supports larger volumes, files, and directories, as well as data integrity checks, self-healing capabilities, and storage virtualization.
- A new web browser called Internet Explorer 10, which is faster, more secure, and more standards-compliant than previous versions. Internet Explorer 10 also supports touch gestures, hardware acceleration, and a new feature called Flip Ahead that allows users to swipe to the next page of a website.
- A new online service called Microsoft Account, which allows users to sync their settings, preferences, files, and apps across multiple devices using the cloud. Users can also access other Microsoft services such as Outlook.com, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, and Windows Store using their Microsoft Account.
- A new app platform called Windows Runtime (WinRT), which allows developers to create modern apps that run on both Windows 8 and Windows RT devices. WinRT apps are written in C#, C++, Visual Basic, or JavaScript, and use a common set of APIs that support touch, sensors, networking, graphics, and media.
- A new feature called Storage Spaces, which allows users to create pools of storage from multiple disks or drives, and then create virtual disks or spaces from those pools. Storage Spaces can also provide redundancy and resiliency by mirroring or striping data across multiple disks or drives.
- A new feature called Hyper-V, which allows users to create and run virtual machines on their Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 computers. Hyper-V supports both 32-bit and 64-bit guest operating systems, as well as live migration, dynamic memory allocation, and remote management.

Windows NT 6.2 also includes many other improvements and enhancements in areas such as security, performance, networking, multimedia, accessibility, power management, and compatibility.
