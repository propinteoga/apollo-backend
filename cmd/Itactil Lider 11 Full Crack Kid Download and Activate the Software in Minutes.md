Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 Pro is an enhanced version of the original Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 game for the Nintendo DS. It features more than 100 new monsters, new areas, new skills, new items, and a new storyline that connects to Dragon Quest IX. However, this game was never released outside of Japan, so fans who want to play it in English have to resort to fan-made patches.
  
In this article, we will show you how to download and play Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 Pro with English patch on your computer or your DS device. You will need a few things before you start:
 
**DOWNLOAD ===== [https://t.co/HGEviM0ZFv](https://t.co/HGEviM0ZFv)**


  
- A ROM file of Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 Pro. You can find it online by searching for "dragon quest monsters joker 2 pro rom". Make sure you download the Japanese version, not the European or American version.
- An English patch file for Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 Pro. You can find it online by searching for "dragon quest monsters joker 2 pro english patch". The latest version available is 1R2, which translates most of the menus and items, but not the story or dialogue.
- A program to apply the patch to the ROM file. You can use xdeltaUI, which is a graphical interface for xdelta, a tool that can create and apply patches. You can download it from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/.
- A program to run the patched ROM file on your computer or your DS device. You can use an emulator like DeSmuME or NO$GBA for your computer, or a flashcart like R4 or Acekard for your DS device.

Once you have all these things ready, follow these steps:

1. Extract the xdeltaUI program and the patch file to a folder on your computer.
2. Open xdeltaUI.exe and click on "Open Patch" button. Browse to the folder where you extracted the patch file and select it.
3. Click on "Open Source File" button. Browse to the folder where you downloaded the ROM file and select it.
4. Click on "Save Output File" button. Choose a name and a location for the patched ROM file. Make sure it has the same extension as the original ROM file (.nds).
5. Click on "Patch" button. Wait for a few seconds until the process is done. You should see a message saying "Successfully patched!"
6. Close xdeltaUI program and delete the patch file. You don't need it anymore.
7. Open the emulator or flashcart program of your choice and load the patched ROM file. Enjoy playing Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 Pro with English patch!

Note: If you encounter any errors or bugs while playing, you can report them to the fan translation team at http://www.woodus.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=19975. They are still working on improving the patch and translating more parts of the game.
