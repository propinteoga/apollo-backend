Here, you can see some information about your system, such as your Windows version, build, edition, architecture, and status. You can also see some options for activation, such as profile selection, serial installation, certificate installation, and SLIC installation.
 
## Step 3: Select a profile and install a serial
 
The first thing you need to do is select a profile that matches your system. You can click on the "Profile" button and choose from a list of preset profiles that contain serials, certificates, and SLICs for various Windows editions. For example, if you have Windows 7 Ultimate x64, you can select the "Windows 7 Ultimate x64" profile.
 
Alternatively, you can click on the "Serial" button and enter your own serial number if you have one. You can also click on the "Random" button to generate a random serial number.
 
After selecting or entering a serial number, click on the "Install" button next to it. You will see a message like this:

This means that the serial number has been installed successfully.
 
## Step 4: Install a certificate and a SLIC
 
The next step is to install a certificate and a SLIC that match your serial number and your system. A certificate is a digital signature that verifies the authenticity of your activation data. A SLIC is a software licensing information code that is embedded in your BIOS or bootloader.
 
You can click on the "Certificate" button and choose from a list of preset certificates that correspond to different manufacturers, such as Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc. For example, if you have a Dell computer, you can select the "Dell.xrm-ms" certificate.
